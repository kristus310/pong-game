# Pong SFML

A simple **Pong** game implemented in C++ using the **SFML** library.  
This project was created as a learning exercise to master SFML basics including graphics, input handling, and sound effects.

## Description

This is a classic Pong game featuring smooth paddle controls, ball physics, and sound effects for collisions and scoring. The game window is **responsive** — it adjusts to different window sizes while maintaining the correct aspect ratio and gameplay experience. This project helped me get familiar with SFML’s window management, drawing shapes, event handling, and audio playback. It’s lightweight and perfect for beginners looking to learn game development in C++ with SFML.
